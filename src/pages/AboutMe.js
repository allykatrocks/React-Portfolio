      Hello! My name is Alex and I'm a junior web developer. I am a graduate
      of San Diego State University with a Bachelor's degree in Theater
      Arts. I began my coding journey in December of 2020 in order to gain
      profitable and relevant skills I can take with me to any career field.
      Please find below a collection of my completed and deployed works as
