        Hello! My name is Alex and I'm a junior web developer. I am a graduate
        of San Diego State University with a Bachelor's degree in Theater Arts.
        I began my coding journey in December of 2020 in order to gain
        profitable and relevant skills I can take with me to any career field.
        With my new found experience, I would love to enter the web development
        world as a front end or React engineer. Please find in this portfolio a
        collection of my completed and deployed works as well as how to contact
        me.
      </p>
